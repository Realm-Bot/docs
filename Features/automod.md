### 1) Block certain devices 
  You can set an automod rule to block certain devices from joining your realm 

   To block a device create a new automod rule and in the devices dropdown turn on devices and select the devices you want to block in the box

### 2) Prevent Alt Accounts 
  You can set Automod Rule to prevent possible alt accounts
  
  Realmbot uses a variety of information like IP address, device information, etc to autonomously calculate if an account is an alt of another account. This is highly accurate in most cases

  To create an automod rule against alt accounts. Create a new automod rule and in the `Alt Score` dropdown turn it on and set the alt score it says how likely a said account is an alt
