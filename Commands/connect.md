# /connect 

## Info
 The /connect command is used to link your Minecraft account and all the realms its own to the discord server you run the command in
 
 You can only run the command if you are either the owner of the discord server or have administrator permission in the server
 
 if you have added the bot to your server for the first time all the other commands like `/realm players` , `/realm permission` will be visible only after you connect a realm by running `/connect`

 ## Common Errors 
 1. `You don't have a Xbox account authorized, authorize your Xbox account at https://realmbot.dev/account and then run `/connect` as the error suggests you have not connected your Xbox account to realm bot and you need to connect it [here]{https://realmbot.dev/account} and then run /connect 
 
 2. `Failed to refresh realms`: this is caused due to your account not being liked to realm bot properly. To fix the issue go [here]{https://realmbot.dev/account} and press unlink and relink and then run /connect again in your guild
