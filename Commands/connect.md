 ## Common Errors 
 1. `You don't have a xbox account authorized, authorize your xbox account at https://realmbot.dev/account and then run /connect` : as the error suggests you have not connected your xbox account to realm bot and you need to connect it [here]{https://realmbot.dev/account} and then run /connect 
 
 2. `Failed to refresh realms` : this is caused due to your account not being liked properly to realm bot. To fix the issue go [here]{https://realmbot.dev/account and press unlink and relink and then run /connect again in your guild
