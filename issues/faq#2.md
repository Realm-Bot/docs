# What is account linking? How safe is this option in comparison to other methods?

---

Account linking is a double counter-like authorization. This will make members link their xbox account to discord so you know who they are! Account linking settings are customizable on the Realm Bot dashboard. Account linking will not send an invite to your realm. Although, realm bot will send a message in the userâ€™s direct messages for verification.
Vanity invites are the safest option for realm invites.
