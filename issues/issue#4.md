# When I use the command connect, the bot says Failed to refresh realms. What can I do to fix?

Make sure you are connecting to the proper account on the dashboard. You have to connect to the account that owns the realm(s).
You can switch your account using this [link](https://realmbot.dev/account)

If you are sure you are connecting the right account, then relink [here](https://realmbot.dev/account) and rerun /connect
