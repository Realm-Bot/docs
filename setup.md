## Video Tutorial

This will explain in detail how to setup Realmbot for your realm!

### Step 1

- First, you need to authorize the Minecraft account that owns the realm to Realmbot. You can do so [here](https://realmbot.dev/account).

### Step 2

- Once you've authorized your account with Realmbot, the next step is to connect that account to Realmbot on your server. To do this, run the `/connect` command in your guild.

### Step 3

- After successfully linking your realm to your guild, you can configure the bot, including command permissions and ban logs, at our [dashboard](https://realmbot.dev).
- For detailed instructions on setting up configurations via the dashboard, please refer to the 'dashboard' section for more information.
