# Realm Bot Setup
 This will explain in detail how to setup realm bot in your guild 

## STEP ONE 
 First, you have to authorise the Minecraft account that owns the realm to realm bot.
 
 You can do so [here](https://realmbot.dev/account).
 
 `If the wrong account is getting connected to realmbot go to https://www.xbox.com/live and login with the correct account there`
 
## STEP TWO 
  After you have authorised your account to realmbot the next step is to connect that account to realmbot on your server 
  
  To connect your account to your guild run the `/connect` command in your guild
