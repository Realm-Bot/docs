## Setting up Account linking
  You can make account linking mandatory by making Realmbot give your default member role to the person after linking their Xbox account and turning off 'view channel' for '@everyone' in all channels.
  
   *You can add the role that must be given to the person that linked his account in the* `Linked Xbox Account Roles` *option in the account linking page*  
  
  You can individually choose the realms a person must be invited to when he links his Xbox account

  You can set these realms in the `Invite to realm(s)` option in the account linking page

  ## How to use Account Linking
  To use the account linking feature, use the `/verify embed` command to send a double counter linke verification embed to the discord channel of your choice for people to verify 

  Alternately, you can also turn on the `send DM on join` option so that the bot DMs the members when they join your discord server
