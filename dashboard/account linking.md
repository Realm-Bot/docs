   *You can add the role that must be given to the person that linked his account in the* `Linked Xbox Account Roles` *option in the account linking page*  
  
  You can individually choose the realms a person must be invited to when he links his Xbox account

  You can set these realms in the `Invite to realm(s)` option in the account linking page
