## Setting up Account linking
  You can make account linking mandatory by making the realm bot give your default member role to the person after linking their xbox account and turning off 'view channel' for '@everyone' in all channels.
  
   *You can add the role that must be given to the person that linked his account in the* `Linked Xbox Account Roles` *option in account linking page*  
  
  You can individually choose the realms a person must be invited to when he links his xbox account

  You can set these realms in the `Invite to realm(s)` option in the account linking page

## In-game notification
   You can choose to send a message to your realms or execute a command in your realm when a person links his xbox account to your guild 
   
   To configure this you can start by pressing the `ADD COMMAND` button at the bottom of the account linking page

   To send a message you can do so like this
